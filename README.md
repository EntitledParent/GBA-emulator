# How to Make your Own Fork
1. Click Fork!
2. Once created head to: Settings --> Pages --> Set Up GitHub Pages
3. All GBA Games work with no configuration! Enjoy

Pretty much all games, including GBA soon, are hosted on an external server. ~There may be a second Repo created to keep the smaller roms in case you want to copy them in yourself.~ Please note that if you do add in roms to your fork, deploy times for GitHub Pages on any changes you may have made will get larger. Currently sits at ~25 mins.

There is now a second repo with our Roms hosted on it! See [Here!](https://github.com/cattn/gba-host)

Any of our games that we host on our server are allowed to be referenced! Please do not abuse this or risk loosing access. Please [reach out](https://discord.gg/nZrabh4cgH) if you would like a local copy of the roms hosted. We will review each request individually.
